# RC Robot
A hardware, Arduino, and RPi project that allows control over a robot's motors.

# Materials
* Arduino
* Power source (for Arduino)
  * Power bank
  * MicroUSB cable
* Motors with encoders (2)
* Relays (3)
* Breadboard
* Wires
* Round wheels (2)
* Freely spinning wheels (1)

# Hardware Setup (So far)
1. Power Arduino with an outlet during testing
2. Power a set of the breadboard's power rails with 12V
3. Attach motors and encoders (Instructions WIP)
4. ...
5. Switch power source for Arduino to Power bank
6. Finally, run the robot!
